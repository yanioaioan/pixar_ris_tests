This directory contains examples of RPS 19's new RIS rendering mode.
These examples employ pattern plugins.

1) bump - shows an example of applying a bump map using the PxrProceduralBump
pattern node. Here the procedural is simply a texture lookup of a heightmap.

2) displacement - shows an example of using an RSL shader for displacement.
Both types of displacement shader are provided. The displacement shader
is parameterized by a pattern network. The same network also provides the
diffuse color to a bxdf.

3) fractalize.rib - shows an example of applications of "mutable" shading 
contexts.  Also: its use of PxrManifold shows "struct dataflow".

4) osl - a pair of examples showing OSL patterns; one shows them on a set
of quads, the other on a shaderball.  Note that you must run oslc *.osl in
the shaders subdirectory first.

4) seexpr - shows 5 examples of SeExpr scripts. 3 procedural textures,
false coloring texture coordinates, and texture compositing.

5) shutterblur - shows how to leverage shutter time in a pattern to do
motion blur in shading.  Note that you must run oslc *.osl in the shaders
subdirectory first.
